CloPeMa Garment Dataset
=======================

This repository contains tools and documentation for publicly available
benchmark datasets for testing and evaluation of garment segmentation,
recognition and folding algorithms -- the [CloPeMa Garment Dataset][web]. The
datasets are free for research and educational purposes only and can be used in
scientific publications at the condition of respecting the requested citation
acknowledgment.

Tools
=====

The annotation is stored in the [YAML][] markup language and The [yamlmatlab][]
library is used for YAML parsing. The library is included in this repository.

In order to get you started we have provide a simple Matlab example that will
read and show the annotation.

Start Matlab in the `src` directory and run the following command:

```
$ example
```

![](doc/fig/example_1.png)
![](doc/fig/example_2.png)

Documentation
=============

This repository also contains a source code for Latex document that describes
the dataset. In order to make the pdf version of the documentation run the
following command in the `doc` directory.

```
$ latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

Note that it requires [latex][] and [latexmk][] to be installed.
